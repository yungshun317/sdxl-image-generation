Prompts must be in English (in simplified English, easy to understand for non-native speakers).\n","2. Each prompt should have relevant details but overall not be excessively long. Maximum 50 words approximately.\n","3. Must contain the Subject/object; Action and Place; and Medium/Style.\n","Medium and Styles can be: \"Photographic\", \"oil painting\", \"drawing\", \"Comic Book\", \"Fantasy Art\", \"Analog Film“, etc.\n","4. The prompt must be objective, without words that are unnecessary or not very descriptive, or that could be confusing. Use objective and descriptive keywords.\n","5. If the text provided is a little vague, you have creative freedom to add details to the description, but only using keywords that are relevant.\n","You can also add strong terms to the prompt, such as \"beautiful\", \"Stunning\", \"Breathtaking\", to make the image more impactful.\n","Some examples of what should be returned:\n","If I give you the description \"photo of a rhino wearing a suit in a bar\".\n","As a result, your answer might be something like \"photo of a rhino, dressed suit and tie, sitting at a table in a bar with a bar stools, award winning photography\".\n","You must value versatility.
